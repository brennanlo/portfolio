                The WSIB Lab is always working on a variety of projects that are of interest to corporate WSIB executives. During monthly meetings,
                 these projects are discussed in-depth with corporate executives in order to inform them of updates, next steps, and whether 
                 or not there needs to be a pivot in terms of Lab work.  
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                However, there is a limited amount of time where corporate executives are able to receive updates and information about our Lab's projects.
                Outside of monthly meetings, the only way for them to be informed of updates is via email communication.

            <h1 class="case-header">Key Considerations</h1>
            <p class="body-text">As a young innovation lab, our current projects didn't have a definitive development lifecycle yet. So, moving forward, the Lab team decided
                on what should normally be included during the start to end of a project. This would help build consistency while viewing different projects.

                  </div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text">Another factor to consider was our primary users. We needed to design a layout that was simple to use and understand since not all users
            were as technically proficient as others. 
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="wireframes">
            <h1 class="case-header">Wireframes</h1>
            <p class="body-text">Once we decided upon the development lifecycles of projects, we started sketching out possible layouts to display our projects. In the early
                designs, we had a card layout that would act as a popout overlay to view more in-depth information about the selected project. However, the problem with this layout was 
                that it didn't take advantage of using full screen real-estate, which was especially important since we were displaying a lot of information.

                Below are some early iterations of design themes for the Project Portfolio.

            <p class="body-text">
                In this version, we really tried to push our new logo, the chameleon, into the design. As a byproduct, our palette included a lot of earth tones.
                However, after a design review, we deemed that it was necessary to change the visual since we wanted to portray thoughts of innovation, technology,
                and modernism to our users instead.

                <p class="body-text">
                    In the second mockup, we went with a cooler colour palette and incorporated one of our Lab's brand colour's. The triangles that float around the sign in page 
                    are meant to be an extrapolation of the triangles that make up the chameleon logo. We were still unsatisfied with this design because of how cold and slightly 
                    unwelcoming it felt. We also had this odd need to feel pressued into display our new Lab logo upfront and center. This affected our visual design process and
                    essentially limited our own creative freedom. In addition to this, we were also challenged to try and incorporate more of our Lab's brand colours.

                    This final mockup drew inspiration from other websites and design trends we explored. The context of the visual illustration was to display the Lab's active process in team contribution while working on various projects. 
                    We also now made use of all of our Lab's brand colours. In turn, we believe that this final design encompassed a better representation of our Lab.
