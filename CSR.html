               Currently, the system of processing insurance claims requires the completion of multiple templates,
                which is complicated, difficult to use, and unintuitive. </p>

<div class="poc1">
  <h1 class="case-header">POC 1 — Guided Form Picker</h1>
  <p class="body-text">The design team decided that a good first step towards simplifying the template system would be to create a guided form picker. This would help introduce newer
     CSRs to the template system, and help guide them towards picking the correct template. <span id="invision">Invision</span> was used in order to create a prototype that could be easily used for usability testing later on. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="body-text">During this POC, our main goals were to create a simple UI that would be easy for CSRs to navigate.</p>
    <p class="body-text">The idea of this prototype was to have the form auto-populate itself as you move along selecting radio buttons and dropdowns. This allows for decreased clutter and confusion for CSRs.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Once CSRs reach the workplan activity, they have to run through a list of exceptions to determine the next steps to be taken. Showcasing the exceptions in this format ensures that CSRs review 
      each exception case before moving forward. This reduces the amount of mistakes that could possibly be made and ensures that claims don't flow down the wrong path because of a missed exception. </p>

    <div class="poc2">
      <h1 class="case-header">POC 2</h1>
      <p class="body-text">The second POC was used to merge the ESU and triage templates together. This was a step towards the goal of having one singular form as a single souce of truth instead of having multiple templates.</p>
      <p class="body-text">Since these two templates already had content that was similar within it, merging these templates would act as a good starting point. This would eliminate redundancies between using the two tempaltes and create a good starting point to merge the rest of the templates later on.</p>

    <div class="next-steps">
      <h1 class="case-header">Next Steps</h1>
      <p class="body-text">User testing has yet to be done on the new ESU/Triage form. Feedback from the corporate CSR manager has also not been given as of yet. As the new design team for the future term takes over this project, they will determine the scope of the next POC.</p>
